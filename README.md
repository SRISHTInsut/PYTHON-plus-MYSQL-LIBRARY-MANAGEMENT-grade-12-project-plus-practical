# PYTHON-plus-MYSQL-LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-grade-12-project-plus-practical
This project was assigned when I was in grade 12. I had Computer Science as my Subject so had to prepare a project. This was prepared with the help of one of my friend as there were the teams of 2 people. This projects mainly contains some basic Python and Database Management through MYSQL. It was saved in one of my PENDRIVE and had some errors, so I recently had to make some tweaks here and there.
